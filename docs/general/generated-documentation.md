  "# Setting Up a Delivery Status Dashboard in Docusaurus

  ## Introduction
  This tutorial aims to guide you through the process of setting up a dashboard to monitor the delivery status of your broadcasts. This will help you identify which messages and to which contacts were not delivered, providing an easy way to track your messages' delivery status.

  ## Prerequisites
  - Access to your Google Cloud Studio and BigQuery instance.
  - Basic knowledge of Docusaurus and Google Cloud Studio.

  ## Understanding the Need for a Delivery Dashboard
  Due to the introduction of frequency capping by Meta, not all broadcasted messages reach their intended recipients. Frequency capping is a move by Meta to reduce the spam marketing messages received by end users on WhatsApp. The delivery rate of our messages is not 100%, hence the need for a delivery status dashboard.

  ## Setting Up the Dashboard
  1. Log into your BigQuery instance.
  2. Follow along with the instructions provided in the webinar to set up your dashboard.

  ## Understanding HSM Recategorization
  Meta has introduced HSM recategorization to restrict the misuse of utility messages for marketing purposes. If Meta detects that a utility message is being used for marketing, the template will be recategorized as a marketing template within 24 hours of its use.

  ## Dealing with HSM Recategorization
  If your utility message gets recategorized as a marketing message, you can appeal the change through your Facebook Business Manager. Alternatively, you can try using different templates or formats to avoid recategorization.

  ## Conclusion
  Setting up a delivery status dashboard in Docusaurus is a crucial step in managing your broadcasts effectively. By following this tutorial, you should now be able to monitor the delivery status of your messages and handle any issues related to HSM recategorization.
