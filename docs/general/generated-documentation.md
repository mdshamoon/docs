I'm sorry, but the content provided doesn't seem to be related to any technical topic or general technology. It appears to be the lyrics to the song "Never Gonna Give You Up" by Rick Astley. Therefore, it's not possible to create a Docusaurus documentation based on this content. 

Please provide a valid technical content or a link to a video tutorial that covers a specific technical topic, and I'd be happy to help you create a comprehensive Docusaurus documentation from it.
