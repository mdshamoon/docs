---

# **Overview**

A . Make a copy of [Glific report template v5.0](https://lookerstudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/21ead9bd-acc2-4327-af1c-d202bbffe28a/page/p_eq3uecja2c)

B . Connect 10 data sources to your BigQuery Account

### Connect `flat fields`, `monthly active users`, `Contact collections`, `success messages` and `flow context` by replacing your Dataset ID into the preset 'Custom Query'.

---

8 . For the Flat Fields data source, select Edit and then update the custom query with **Dataset ID** (from the Glific settings interface for big query as shown in the note above). Replace `tides-saas-309509.917302307943` with your **Dataset ID** (Refer to the image below)

**Note:** Ensure that you only replace the **Dataset ID**, that is, ".contacts" should not be deleted. This applies for all steps where you replace the **Dataset ID**, ensure you do not select and paste over the remaining text.

10 . Verify the field types. (Refer Step 6.f.) And then click `Done`

11 . Follow steps 8 to 10 as above for; `Monthly active users`, `Contact Collections` and `Success Messages`, Replace the **Dataset ID** as per your setup.

12 . For Flow context data source update the custom query with **Dataset ID** (from the Glific settings interface for big query). There will be four places where you need to update the **Dataset ID**

---

### Connect `flow Results` and `Contact Collection` by running a query in BigQuery before connecting the data sources.

---

13 . For Flow results. First go to your BigQuery account. Open a new tab and run below query. Replace `tides-saas-309509.917302307943` with your **Dataset ID**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32592458/212663971-569e3848-7a8a-44ff-813a-f044962c3397.png)

```
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION `tides-saas-309509.917302307943.jsonObjectKeys`(input STRING) RETURNS ARRAY<STRING> LANGUAGE js AS R"""
const inputJson=JSON.parse(input)
 return Object.keys(inputJson).map((key) => {
 return (JSON.stringify([key, inputJson[key].input]));
});
""";
```

14 . Click on the `Run` button. After successful execution a new Routine will be created with name `JsonObjectKeys` (refer image below)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32592458/212664014-f6f114ce-6677-4b86-a360-bf801280985d.png)

15 . Go back to DataStudio and follow the same steps as we did for Flat fields (9 to 11) above for `Flow Results` data source. (Replace the **Dataset ID** as per your setup in 2 lines.)

16 . For Contact Collection. Again go to your BigQuery account. Open a new tab and run below query. Replace `tides-saas-309509.917302307943` with your **Dataset ID**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32592458/212663971-569e3848-7a8a-44ff-813a-f044962c3397.png)

```
BEGIN
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW
  `tides-saas-309509.917302307943.contact_collection` AS (
  SELECT
    name,
    phone,
    group_name
  FROM
    `tides-saas-309509.917302307943.contacts`,
    UNNEST(SPLIT(group_labels, ',')) group_name);
END
```

17 . Click on the `Run` button. After successful execution a new Routine will be created with name `contact_collection` (refer image below)

<img width="1470" alt="Image 4" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/119285990/217206706-0a8d37e6-ef58-46d5-b4e1-0a4ba458bcff.png" />

18 . Go back to DataStudio and follow the same steps as we did for `contacts` (6 and 7) above to connect the `Contact Collection` data source.

19  . **Masked Phone Numbers**

<img width="1028" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-16 at 3 21 29 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6fa394c8-768d-4ac5-88df-1aa65793762c" />

If you want to reveal the phone numbers in your dashboard
1. In your dashboard, navigate to the table where you want to unmask the phone numbers.
2. Click on the edit button, then select the table.
3. On the right-hand side, under `Dimension`, click on `Add Dimension`.
4. Search for `contact_phone` (in some cases, it may be listed as `Phone`) under the default group. Add it, then remove the previous `Phone` from the dimension.

20 . Click `CLOSE` on the top right, and your reports will be ready
