# Why should you connect to the V5 Template Dashboard?
Deploying your chatbot program can generate tremendous value at scale for your users, **the template dashboard enables the crucial other half of your chatbot program.** 
- It enables your organisation to **monitor and evaluate the health of your chatbot program**, so that you may iterate and improve the experience for your users. 
- The dashboard **also serves as a repository of user information that your field/remote operations teams can easily download** to engage more deeply with your stakeholders.


The template dashboard aims to make as much common chatbot program information accessible to your organisation as possible. You may use what is relevant to your program. Beyond this, you might want to tweak this dashboard to further suit your needs, refer to [google support](https://support.google.com/looker-studio/?hl=en#topic=6291037) to learn how to do this.

# Understanding the pages in the Dashboard
## 1. Overview
This page has been created to give your organisation a sense of the overall health of your chatbot progream. It is divided into 3 broad sections, described below.
The page has one date range filter at the top left which is set to the last 30 days by default.

### Stakeholder Engagement Overview

<img width="1470" alt="Image 1" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/119285990/221197664-d1562527-f65f-4c75-bf4e-2412c8868abb.png"/>

This section of the overview page tells you about the number of people/phone numbers that have engaged (sent or recieved messages) with your chatbot.
- **Contacts reached since launch:** The total number of phone numbers that have ever engaged with your chatbot till today. This number will not change when you alter the date range filter.
- **Active Contacts (recieving messages):** The total number of phone numbers that have recieved a message in the selected time period. 
It is important to note that all contacts who have recieved a message might not have sent a message back to you, but all those who have sent a message to your bot would definitely have recieved a message back.
- **Contacts sending messages:** The total number of phone numbers that have sent a message to your chatbot in the selected time period. This is a subset of your Active Contacts value.
- **Sending/Active:** The percentage of phone numbers who are sending messaged to your chatbot as compared to the total number of phone numbers that have received messages. Based on the nature of your program you could decide what percentage indicates good engagement. 
- **Active contacts and messages exchanged graph:** This is a very useful graph that helps you analyse the trends of contacts engaged and messages sent over time. 

    **Note:** _If you hover your cursor over the top right corner of this graph and click on the down arrow, you can learn about engagement trends over months, days of the week and hours of the day. Give it a try!_

### Messages and Conversations Overview

<img width="1469" alt="Image 2" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/119285990/221197690-1a7de6cb-8f4b-4cec-878c-192e53ae835e.png"/>

This section of the overview page tells you about the number and types of messages and conversations you have exchanged. Messages and conversations impact costs and can be seen in further detail the _conversation costs_ page of your report.
- **Messages exchanged:** The total number of messages that have been sent by the bot (outgoing) or recieved by the bot (incoming) in the selected time period.
- **Outgoing and Incoming messages pie chart:** The distribution of total messages exchanged.
- **Outgoing and Incoming messages graph:** The daywise trend of messages exchanged over time.
- **Conversations started:** The total number of unique conversations started during the selected time period. A single conversation is defined a 24 hour window from the first message sent by your bot.

### Contact Opt in/Opt out Overview

This section is especially useful during the onboarding phase/s of your program. An important first step in using the chatbot is getting your users consent or to 'opt in' to receive messages from you. This is required by WA/Facebook to ensure that people do not recieve spam messages.
- **Opt in since launch:** The total contacts who have opted in since your chatbot started
- **New optins:** The users who have opted in during the selected time period.
- **Optin Graph:** The day wise trend of optins for the selected time period.

This section helps you investgate which flows have been killed, at which node, and for which contact. Flows can be killed if contacts do not respond for 7 days, if a webhook fails, if they fall into an infinite loop, or if you manually terminate the flow.
Using this you can identify where and how to improve your flows.
- **Total incomplete and killed flows:** The number in the box indicated the count of unique flows that have been killed for some contacts.
- **Flow name table:** The list of killed flows out of the flows that you have selected and the number of contacts for whom the flow is killed.
