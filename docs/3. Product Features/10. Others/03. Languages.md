## Test the flow in a different language

To test the flows in different languages, the user needs to change the language preference of the contact who is testing. And then execute the flow, which needs to be tested.

There are two ways to change the language.

1 . Type language and send it to BOT (it will execute the language flow ) and change contact language.

2 .  Change the contact language from the user&#39;s profile.

a) Click on the View Contact Profile.
