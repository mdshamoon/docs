Steps 1: Create and Approve English Template
   1. Click “Create Template.”
   2. Fill in the template in English, with a unique element name. 
   3. Choose category (e.g., Utility, Marketing).
   4. Submit the template for approval.
   5. Wait until it is approved by WhatsApp.

**English**

<img width="519" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29764c5c-80c9-487c-bbe2-857b86c0486b"/>

Step 2: Create the Template in Another Language (e.g., Hindi)
   1. Click “Create Template.”
   2. Select “Language Variant” from the drop-down.

      <img width="519" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/918237e0-6b73-42fc-b7a2-33bc4803e542"/>
   
   4. Choose the target language (e.g., Hindi).
   5. Important: Check the “Translate existing HSM” box.

      <img width="519" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29300f35-8e13-4e3a-a8bd-8d0d8bc54028"/>

      <img width="519" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5dfd616b-eb38-4896-a730-16abf2e44d15"/>

      _This reveals a dropdown of element names from already approved HSM templates._
      
   7. Select the same element name as the English template (e.g., multi_lingual_hsm_test).
   8. Alternatively, Enter the same Element Name as the approved English version. (_This links both templates under the same template family_)
   9. Input the translated version of the HSM message in Hindi
   10. Submit for approval.

**Hindi**

<img width="499" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b76dc4a-ae76-4473-91af-1e1650799c34"/>

Step 3: Repeat for Other Languages (Optional)
   1. Follow Step 2 for additional languages (e.g., Marathi, Kannada, Tamil).
   2. Always ensure:
      Same element name
      Accurate translation
      Matched placeholders

Note: Now when adding the template in flow, you can add English template in default language flow. If contact selects a different language (Hindi), then the Hindi version of HSM will be send to the contact.
