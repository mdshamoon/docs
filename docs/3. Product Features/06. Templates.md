## How to use HSM Templates in your flows

Common messages used in flow are session messages, which are open to send only within the 24 hours of users sending a message. If beneficiary responds within 24 hours, the session remains active. After 24 hours NGO users cannot send messages on chat bot to the beneficiary, until they send some message from their WhatsApp.

Remaining hours of session messages expiry can be checked from contact list under search section in left pane.

By default, there is a **limit of 250 HSM templates per phone number**. If incase more HSM templates are required, then you need to submit a request to WhatsApp to increase the limit.

## Suggestions to get the HSM template approved

1. **Avoid doing** - Hi, here are the activities for today. We hope you complete them by the end of the day and submit them.
1. **Instead do** - Hi @nameofperson, following are the activities we have assigned for you and we hope you can complete them and submit them by the end of the day. Thank you.
1. Keeping the **_messages personal and interactive_** with an old beneficiary helps in the approval of the HSM template.
1. GCS **_attachments link should be public_** and working for the beneficiary to access it.
1. **_Use absolute URL_** in HSM text. Short URLs don&#39;t work and the template got rejected with an error message &quot;Invalid format&quot;
1. **Emojis are not allowed** in HSM buttons. If you add emojis the template will be rejected.
1. **GIFs are not allowed** in HSM attachments. If you add Gifs as an attachment, it will be rejected.
