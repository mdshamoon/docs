**Glific has some predefined variables to use. Organisations can also define their custom variables when needed. It is recommended not to have many custom variables defined. Anything under 20 is good number of custom variables.**

2 . In `Wait for response` node define the variable name in `result name` section. In this example variable name is  **schoolname .**

**_(Note: Please use variable name in lowercase and it should be without any space in between two words. You can use underscore &quot;_&quot; if you want to put in the name)._**

## Update the Contact 

1 . Next to `wait for response` node and another `update contact`node.

2 .  Enter variable name in `Select what to update` section.

We suggest to keep the variable name same to avoid any confusion. You can keep this name different also. **_Note - The value in the update contact will be save with this variable name._**

3 . Enter the syntax of the variable name defined in `wait for response`  section .  It should be written as **@results.variable name**. Like in this example it will be  `@results.schoolname`

4 . If you would like to store the category instead of the value, you can use **@results.variable name.category**. Like in this example it will be `@results.schoolname.category`
