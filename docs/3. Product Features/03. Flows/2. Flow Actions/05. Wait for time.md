**Wait for time flow action is used to send a message after a specified time gap. This feature is used to ensure that messages are send within a time interval. For instance, an activity is assigned to a student and the Glific Bot checks with the student whether it is complete in one hour.**

**If the wait time is not selected, then it will put a gap of 5 seconds by default.**
